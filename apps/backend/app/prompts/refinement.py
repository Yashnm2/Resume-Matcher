# Prompt for injecting missing keywords into a resume
KEYWORD_INJECTION_PROMPT = """Inject the following keywords into this resume by reframing the candidate's existing experience in the job description's language. Target EVERY section (summary, work experience, projects, technical skills) by default.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Only reframe with keywords the master resume substantively supports (e.g., if the master shows "used Python for data analysis", surface "Python" and "data analysis" language)
2. Do NOT add skills, technologies, or certifications not in the master resume
3. Rephrase existing bullet points and content to include keywords - do not invent new content, metrics, or work history
4. Maintain the exact same JSON structure
5. Do not use em-dashes (—) or their variants (---, --)
6. Make keyword incorporation the DEFAULT across all content sections, not an optional enhancement
7. Prioritize explicit must-have requirements, then preferred qualifications,
   then responsibility-linked terms; ignore benefits and company boilerplate
8. Scan EVERY section by DEFAULT, but change only relevant evidence.
   Never force a keyword into an unrelated bullet
9. Put keywords in context with the action, work, and supported outcome; do not
   create a stuffed keyword list or repeat a term mechanically
10. Preserve every original skill and list item when reordering; place the most
    job-relevant verified items first
11. Prefer the exact JD phrase and its acronym or full-term variant only when
    natural and supported by the master resume
12. Preserve the candidate's actual ownership and seniority. Adjacent experience
    is not permission to claim direct experience
13. Prefer concise Action + Project/Task + Result bullets. If the source has no
    metric, retain a truthful scope, method, audience, complexity, deliverable,
    or qualitative outcome

Keywords to inject (only if supported by master resume):
{keywords_to_inject}

Current tailored resume:
{current_resume}

Master resume (source of truth):
{master_resume}

Job description context:
{job_description}

Output the complete resume JSON with keywords naturally integrated. Return ONLY valid JSON."""


# Prompt for validation and polish pass
VALIDATION_POLISH_PROMPT = """Review and polish this resume content. Remove any AI-sounding language and ensure all content is truthful.

REMOVE or REPLACE:
- Buzzwords: "spearheaded", "synergy", "leverage", "orchestrated", etc.
- Em-dashes (use commas or semicolons instead)
- Overly formal language: "utilized" -> "used", "endeavored" -> "worked"
- Generic filler: "in order to" -> "to"

VERIFY:
- All skills exist in the master resume
- All certifications exist in the master resume
- No fabricated metrics or achievements
- The summary is concise, evidence-backed, and front-loads the strongest job
  match without first-person pronouns
- Each bullet communicates one accomplishment with active voice and a precise verb
- Metrics appear only when supported; otherwise use truthful scope, method,
  audience, complexity, or qualitative outcome
- Keywords are natural, relevant, and contextual rather than stuffed or repeated
- Existing entries remain in reverse chronology, and every original
  skill/certification/language/award remains present

Resume to polish:
{resume}

Master resume (verify all claims against this):
{master_resume}

Output the polished resume JSON. Return ONLY valid JSON."""
